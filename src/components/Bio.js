        <p>Greenhouse builds quality products — really before anything else, this is what drew me to this open frontend engineering position. The design principles the teams demonstrate, the seamless UI, I feel I can learn a lot by engaging with the company’s dynamic engineering team. The individuals I’ve met through Bobby Cardos, one of your data analysts, have all been kind, creative and passionate people. I’m drawn by the company’s commitment to transparency. It’s something I’ve sought at every company I’ve worked for to date, and seems a big part of Greenhouse’s mission. I want to build tools and sites that are in demand, that help the internet as a whole become a more seamless and connected place, and I feel I can do that at Greenhouse better than just about anywhere else.</p>
